# digest

A digestive for data structures constructed from results stemming from
Viome Gut Intelligence TestÂ® kits.

# Description

Package `digest` lets you construct collections of Food objects, and
efficiently search, filter and sort them. It has built-in data parsers and
validators, and can sanitize queries passed to the collection.

# Installation

The package is not published on `npm`. I thought it was too simple to be published.
Instead, users can clone this repo into their project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeanmathieupotvin/digest

Alternatively, they can download an [official release](https://github.com/jeanmathieupotvin/digest/releases) from this repository.
